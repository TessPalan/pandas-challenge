Data Analyzing: Heroes of Pymoli

Background: Fantasy Game - Heroes of Pymoli. 
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

The Final report will include:

    1. Player Count 

    2. Purchasing Analysis (Total)

    3. Gender Demographics

        a. Purchasing Analysis (Gender) 

    4. Age Demographics

        a. Purchasing Analysis (Age)

    5. Top Spenders

    6. Most Popular Items

    7. Most Profitable Items 
    
3 trends based on the data:

    1. The ave. total purchase per person for females in bigger than the ave. total purchase per person for males even though the total purchase value of males is three times bigger than the total purchase value of the females. 
    
    2. Since the items "persuasion and "Exatraction, Quickblade Of Trembling Hands" are in the top 5 most popular items but not in the most profitable items, the prices for thse items should be higher. 
    
    3. The items "Final Critic" and "Oatbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm" are both of the top of the list of most popular and the most profitable in the game. The item "Fiery Glass Crusader" is also in the top five of both most popular and most profitable but is lower on the list of most profitable.
